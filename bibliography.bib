Walking and walkability provide a variety of benefits, including accessibility, consumer cost savings, public cost savings (reduced external costs), more efficient land use, community livability, improved fitness and public health, economic development, and support for equity objectives. Yet current transportation planning practices tend to undervalue walking. More comprehensive analysis techniques are likely to increase public support for walking and other nonmotorized modes of travel.},

This study makes three contributions to address road damage detection issues. First, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, a large-scale road damage data set is prepared, comprising 9,053 road damage images captured using a smartphone installed on a car, with 15,435 instances of road surface damage included in these road images. Next, we used state-of-the-art object detection methods using convolutional neural networks to train the damage detection model with our data set, and compared the accuracy and runtime speed on both, using a GPU server and a smartphone. Finally, we demonstrate that the type of damage can be classified into eight types with high accuracy by applying the proposed object detection method. The road damage data set, our experimental results, and the developed smartphone application used in this study are publicly available (https://github.com/sekilab/RoadDamageDetector/).},

  abstract = {The paradigm of citizen-science, i.e., scientific research that is conducted in whole or in part by non-professional scientists, has gained popularity lately, e.g., for the purpose of crowdsourced data collection. Smartphones with their abundance and ubiquity are perfectly suited and have been widely used for crowdsourced data collection in real life settings. The ongoing, EC-funded research programme named BigO exploits the citizen-science paradigm to collect behavioral (eating, sleeping and physical activity) and affective (mood) data from children populations by means of a novel smartphone application with the intention of developing a decision support system to assist public health authorities in effective policy making against childhood obesity. This paper presents the development \textendash{} in the context of BigO \textendash{} of the myBigO app, one of the first citizen-scientist smartphone applications addressed to children for behavioral and affective data collection. This includes the design, implementation, and deployment of myBigO app in a number of data collection studies as well as its preliminary evaluation with respect to technical robustness and user experience in the context of these studies.},

  abstract = {Contemporary cities are being fragmented by growing number of technical barriers like roads, railways, infrastructural objects, that generate variety of problems of different nature. The aim of the research is to present the issues connected with such barriers in the city and the ways of solving them. Main problems are e.g.: the destruction of the complexity of urban fabric, functional disadvantages, environmental and landscape threats. In order to avoid such negative effects, city should be designed as a coherent organism in terms of spatial, environmental, infrastructural, social and visual aspects. Thus, public spaces should connect an urban tissue. A technical approach should be complemented with humanistic design aspects. This can be obtained thanks to well designed and functioning public spaces that is the essence of a city. However, a good public space should meet a number of conditions. When creating public spaces, it is important not to limit it only to its physical attributes but it should lead to strengthening the relationships. The public space has to fulfil certain functions, be safe, accessible, and attractive. Only such public space can effectively connect urban fabric not only in a spatial way but also by improving the urban life. The main issue discussed in the article is crossing the borders, like roads, between green spaces and city structures. The theoretical background is followed by the assessment of two case studies: Charles River Esplanade in Boston, USA and Reagan's Park in Gdansk, Poland.},

To improve products concerning these quality aspects it is thus also important to be able to measure user experience in an efficient and reliable way. But measuring user experience is not an end in itself. Several different questions can be the reason behind the wish to measure the user experience of a product quantitatively. We discuss several typical questions associated with the measurement of user experience and we show how these questions can be answered with a questionnaire with relatively low effort. In this paper the user experience questionnaire UEQ is used, but the general approach may be transferred to other questionnaires as well.},

In this paper we describe a benchmark for the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ), a widely used evaluation tool for interactive products. We also describe how the benchmark can be applied to the quality assurance process for concrete projects.},

  abstract = {Pavement crack detection and characterization is a fundamental part of road intelligent maintenance systems. Due to the high non-uniformity of cracks, topological complexity, and similar noise from crack texture, the challenge arises in this domain with automated crack detection and classification in a complex environment. In this work, an overarching framework for a universal and robust automatic method that simultaneously characterizes the type of crack and its severity level was developed. For crack detection, we propose a novel and efficient crack detection network that captures the crack context information by establishing a multiscale dilated convolution module. On this foundation, an attention mechanism is introduced to further refine the high-level features. Moreover, the rich features at different levels are fused in an upsampling module to generate more detailed crack detection results. For crack classification, a novel characterization algorithm is developed to classify the type of crack after detection. The crack segment branches are then merged and classified into four types: transversal, longitudinal, block, and alligator; the severity levels of cracks are assessed by calculating the average width and distance between the crack branches. The proposed crack detection method effectively detects crack information in a complex environment, and achieves the current state-of-the-art accuracy. Compared to manual classification results, the classification accuracy of transversal and longitudinal cracks is higher than 95\%, and the classification accuracy of block and alligator is above 86\%.},

A wellarchitected Android app is beneficial for developers, e.g. in terms of maintainability, testability, performance, and avoidance of resource leaks. However, how to properly architect Android apps is still debated and subject to conflicting opinions usually influenced by technological hypes rather than objective evidence. In this paper we present an empirical study on how developers architect Android apps, what architectural patterns and practices Android apps are based on, and their potential impact on quality. We apply a mixed-method empirical research design that combines (i) semi-structured interviews with Android practitioners in the field and (ii) a systematic analysis of both the grey (i.e., websites, on-line blogs) and white literature (i.e., academic studies) on the architecture of Android apps. Based on the analysis of the state of the art and practice about architecting Android apps, we systematically extract a set of 42 evidencebased guidelines supporting developers when architecting their Android apps.},

Environmental and mobility issues represent two key areas where policy makers address their interventions and, amongst them, noise pollution is one of the most significant causes of public concern. However, noise monitoring campaigns are expensive and require skilled personnel. A viable alternative is represented by Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) paradigm, which exploits mobile devices as sensing platforms. In this paper, we propose a MCSbased platform that exploits noise measurements collected by citizens and offers a suggestion system to city managers about noise abatement measures (in terms of both estimated noise reduction and average installation costs). Several field tests demonstrated the feasibility of this approach as a suitable way to support city managers and to widen the possibilities of collaborative urban noise monitoring.},

However, it remains a challenging task due to the intensity inhomogeneity of cracks and complexity of the background, e.g., the low contrast with surrounding pavement and possible shadows with similar intensity. Inspired by recent success on applying deep learning to computer vision and medical problems, a deep-learning based method for crack detection is proposed in this paper. A supervised deep convolutional neural network is trained to classify each image patch in the collected images. Quantitative evaluation conducted on a data set of 500 images of size 3264 {$\chi$} 2448, collected by a low-cost smart phone, demonstrates that the learned deep features with the proposed deep learning framework provide superior crack detection performance when compared with features extracted with existing hand-craft methods.},
