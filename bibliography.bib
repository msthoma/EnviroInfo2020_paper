  abstract = {Digital geographical maps can be regarded as a user interface for understanding and navigating the city. Nevertheless, contemporary digital maps over-emphasize the needs of motor vehicles. Pedestrian routes have only been considered as an add-on option in existing digital maps and the respective data collection has not been performed in the field. In this article, we present a mobile application that employs gamification as a means to engage users to collect pragmatic data about walkable routes, which are then processed with the goal of creating a new kind of pedestrian-friendly cartography. Besides the technical infrastructure for collecting and filtering the route traces, the main challenge in user-generated walkable routes is the identification of malicious data, which should be rejected, as well as the rewarding of constructive behavior through peer-review. For this purpose, the mobile application employs a point system in order to identify and discourage the submission of bad routes. A longitudinal (2-months) field study of the mobile application confirmed that gamification facilitates effective data collection for producing pedestrian cartography even with few users and demonstrated that gamification infuses a shared responsibly about the quality of data collection. The visualization of the pedestrian-generated data on a map required a partially manual process, thus, further research should explore the gamification of the data visualization part, too.},

  abstract = {The paradigm of citizen-science, i.e., scientific research that is conducted in whole or in part by non-professional scientists, has gained popularity lately, e.g., for the purpose of crowdsourced data collection. Smartphones with their abundance and ubiquity are perfectly suited and have been widely used for crowdsourced data collection in real life settings. The ongoing, EC-funded research programme named BigO exploits the citizen-science paradigm to collect behavioral (eating, sleeping and physical activity) and affective (mood) data from children populations by means of a novel smartphone application with the intention of developing a decision support system to assist public health authorities in effective policy making against childhood obesity. This paper presents the development \textendash{} in the context of BigO \textendash{} of the myBigO app, one of the first citizen-scientist smartphone applications addressed to children for behavioral and affective data collection. This includes the design, implementation, and deployment of myBigO app in a number of data collection studies as well as its preliminary evaluation with respect to technical robustness and user experience in the context of these studies.},

The investigation is based on a review of available Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as well as existing applications. A survey is also carried out in order to evaluate young peoples' attitudes on aspects of active mobility and the necessity for a smart pedestrian application. The collected data was statistically analyzed, whereby important requirements were elicited for software development. It was shown that the survey method is an effective way for gathering initial requirements and verifying whether it is worthwhile to proceed to software development and implementation. Regarding the application, young people are quite positive on the prospects for a smart pedestrian navigation system.},

  abstract = {Contemporary cities are being fragmented by growing number of technical barriers like roads, railways, infrastructural objects, that generate variety of problems of different nature. The aim of the research is to present the issues connected with such barriers in the city and the ways of solving them. Main problems are e.g.: the destruction of the complexity of urban fabric, functional disadvantages, environmental and landscape threats. In order to avoid such negative effects, city should be designed as a coherent organism in terms of spatial, environmental, infrastructural, social and visual aspects. Thus, public spaces should connect an urban tissue. A technical approach should be complemented with humanistic design aspects. This can be obtained thanks to well designed and functioning public spaces that is the essence of a city. However, a good public space should meet a number of conditions. When creating public spaces, it is important not to limit it only to its physical attributes but it should lead to strengthening the relationships. The public space has to fulfil certain functions, be safe, accessible, and attractive. Only such public space can effectively connect urban fabric not only in a spatial way but also by improving the urban life. The main issue discussed in the article is crossing the borders, like roads, between green spaces and city structures. The theoretical background is followed by the assessment of two case studies: Charles River Esplanade in Boston, USA and Reagan's Park in Gdansk, Poland.},

To improve products concerning these quality aspects it is thus also important to be able to measure user experience in an efficient and reliable way. But measuring user experience is not an end in itself. Several different questions can be the reason behind the wish to measure the user experience of a product quantitatively. We discuss several typical questions associated with the measurement of user experience and we show how these questions can be answered with a questionnaire with relatively low effort. In this paper the user experience questionnaire UEQ is used, but the general approach may be transferred to other questionnaires as well.},

It allows comparing the results of one product to a large set of other products. In this paper we describe a benchmark for the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ), a widely used evaluation tool for interactive products. We also describe how the benchmark can be applied to the quality assurance process for concrete projects.},

  abstract = {For surviving in the highly competitive market of Android apps, it is fundamental for app developers to deliver apps of high quality and with short release times. A wellarchitected Android app is beneficial for developers, e.g. in terms of maintainability, testability, performance, and avoidance of resource leaks. However, how to properly architect Android apps is still debated and subject to conflicting opinions usually influenced by technological hypes rather than objective evidence. In this paper we present an empirical study on how developers architect Android apps, what architectural patterns and practices Android apps are based on, and their potential impact on quality. We apply a mixed-method empirical research design that combines (i) semi-structured interviews with Android practitioners in the field and (ii) a systematic analysis of both the grey (i.e., websites, on-line blogs) and white literature (i.e., academic studies) on the architecture of Android apps. Based on the analysis of the state of the art and practice about architecting Android apps, we systematically extract a set of 42 evidencebased guidelines supporting developers when architecting their Android apps.},

  abstract = {Research in social science has shown that mobile phone conversations distract users, presenting a significant impact to pedestrian safety; for example, a mobile phone user deep in conversation while crossing a street is generally more at risk than other pedestrians not engaged in such behavior. We propose WalkSafe, an Android smartphone application that aids people that walk and talk, improving the safety of pedestrian mobile phone users. WalkSafe uses the back camera of the mobile phone to detect vehicles approaching the user, alerting the user of a potentially unsafe situation; more specifically WalkSafe i) uses machine learning algorithms implemented on the phone to detect the front views and back views of moving vehicles and ii) exploits phone APIs to save energy by running the vehicle detection algorithm only during active calls. We present our initial design, implementation and evaluation of the WalkSafe App that is capable of real-time detection of the front and back views of cars, indicating cars are approaching or moving away from the user, respectively. WalkSafe is implemented on Android phones and alerts the user of unsafe conditions using sound and vibration from the phone. WalkSafe is available on Android Market.},
